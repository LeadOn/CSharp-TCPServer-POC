# CSharp-TCPServer-POC - Diiage 2022

This is just a tiny poc of a simple multi-threaded TCPServer using .NET Core, made while working on .NETGame at #Diiage.
You just need to copy this repo, and launch the program.
You can type arguments while launching this program: first one is the IP address, the second one is the server port.

There is no error gestion with IP/Port, you will need to code that!

Actually, this server creates a dedicated thread by user connection, and displays every message into server console.
